# Agents

This directory stores GitHub Copilot coding agent instruction files.

Each agent is defined as a Markdown (`.md`) file. Place your locally created agent files here to store and share them via GitHub.

## Usage

1. Copy your agent `.md` files into this directory.
2. Commit and push to GitHub as you would any other file.

For more information on creating and using agents, see the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/reusing-prompts-and-instructions-in-github-copilot#about-copilot-coding-agents).
