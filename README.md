# Optima-Partners

This repository is for the Optima Partners engineering assignments assessment. Specifically, the repositary is for the data engineering assessment.
<https://github.com/optima-partners/engineering-recruitment-assignments/blob/main/data-engineering/datapipeline/>

## Project layout

- `source-data/` : Raw CSV inputs used by the analysis. Key files:
  - `races.csv` — high-level data for each race including date and time. Requirements are to combine date and time as one utc field, where null, time can be set as 00:00:00
  - `results.csv` — finishing position of each driver per race including fastest lap.
- `results/`    : Generated outputs (JSON files) by year, e.g. `stats_2018.json` through `stats_2024.json`.
- `solution/`   :
  - `main.py` — script to import the CSVs and join based on `raceId`. Filters results to include only race winners (position = 1) and creates one JSON file per year with race statistics.
  - `functions.py` — contains the `import_csv_to_df()` function for importing CSV files to pandas DataFrames with configurable delimiters and index columns.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13.9 or higher
- pandas library
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ijward/Optima-Partners.git
   cd Optima-Partners
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. **Run the data pipeline**

   From the project root directory, execute:

   ```bash
   python3 solution/main.py
   ```

   Or, if using Python 3 as default:

   ```bash
   python solution/main.py
   ```

### Expected Output

When successful, the script will:

- Read CSV files from `source-data/` directory:
  - `races.csv` — race metadata with dates and times
  - `results.csv` — driver finishing positions and lap data
- Combine date and time fields into a single UTC datetime field (using "00:00:00" for null times)
- Filter results to include only race winners (position = 1)
- Join the datasets based on `raceId`
- Generate JSON output files in `results/` directory, organized by year:
  - `stats_2018.json` through `stats_2024.json`

Each output JSON file contains the following fields for that year's races:

- `year` — the race year
- `Race Name` — the name of the race
- `Race Round` — the round number in the season
- `Race Datetime` — the combined UTC datetime of the race
- `Race Winning driverId` — the driver ID of the race winner
- `Race Fastest Lap` — the fastest lap time recorded in the race

### Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'**: Install pandas using `pip install pandas`
- **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure you're running the script from the project root directory
- **Permission denied**: On macOS/Linux, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests and quality checks:

### Running Tests

Execute all tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=functions --cov-report=html
```

### Test Coverage

- **test_process.py**: Core functionality tests
  - `test_import_csv_to_df_no_index()` — validates CSV import without index
  - `test_import_csv_to_df_no_delimiter()` — validates default delimiter handling
  - `test_import_csv_to_df_with_index_in_races()` — validates index setting for races data
  - `test_import_csv_to_df_with_index_in_results()` — validates index setting for results data
  - `test_csv_to_def_file_path_has_leading_trailing_slashes()` — handles path normalization
  - `test_import_csv_to_df_missing_file_raises()` — validates error handling for missing files
  - `test_import_csv_to_df_index_col_missing_raises()` — validates error handling for invalid index columns
  - `test_each_race_has_position_one_winner()` — validates race-winner relationships
